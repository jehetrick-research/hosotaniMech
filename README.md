# Hosotani Mechanism Simulations

This repo stores MILC code simulating the Hosotani Mechanism in SU(3).

Status so far:

Over the past year, I have been trying to understand how SU(3) gauge symmetry is broke by the Hosotani
Mechanism on the lattice.

A cheap way to mimic periodic adjoint fermions is to add a $-h\Tr(P)$ term to the action.

In the fall of 2016, I got this working.

Now, I'm trying to see if I can see magnetic screening of monopoles in a "Flux Capacitor" a la DeGrand
and Toussaint.
